Find notes with similar meaning intelligently, helping you uncover hidden connections and insights within your Obsidian vault. Built with privacy in mind, this plugin operates entirely on your local device—your data stays private and secure.

## Features

- **Fully Local and Private**: Your notes and data are never sent outside your device. All processing is done locally to ensure complete privacy.


## Usage

1. After enabling the plugin, a telescope icon will appear in the note’s right sidebar within a few seconds.
2. On first use, you’ll see a button to start indexing your vault.
3. Indexing can take anywhere from 1 to 20 minutes depending on your device and vault size, so it's not recommended to do this on mobile.
4. Once indexing is complete, open any note and click the telescope icon to see notes that are most similar in meaning.
5. Click any note in the list to navigate to it.
6. Use the refresh button to update the list of related notes.

## Privacy and Security

One of Obsidian's greatest strengths is its commitment to data ownership and privacy. This plugin upholds that philosophy by making privacy its highest priority. All processing and note relations happen entirely on your device, ensuring your notes stay yours—always. 

**Related Notes Finder** is built with privacy at its core:  
- **Local Processing**: Every analysis and operation occurs directly on your device. Your notes never leave your vault.  
- **No Third-Party Dependencies**: Once installed, the plugin requires no internet access or external APIs, providing a fully private and secure experience.
