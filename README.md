<summary>Note From the Creator</summary>
This plugin excites me. For me, Obsidian‚Äôs greatest value lies in reducing the strain of writing. The whole Zettelkasten approach‚Äîdon‚Äôt worry about structure, just focus on relationships‚Äîis an amazing method to capture thoughts and build a personal knowledge base. However, there‚Äôs still one significant pain point in my writing routine: relating notes. It‚Äôs challenging to remember existing notes (especially when you have over a thousand) and decide how to connect them. This plugin aims to ease that burden by presenting an overview of the most closely related notes in meaning‚Äîall while staying local and on-device, a core Obsidian principle that I deeply value.

<summary>The Technology Behind Driving It</summary>
I won‚Äôt delve into too much detail or documentation here, but I can‚Äôt help but rave about the incredible technology that powers this plugin. At its core is an AI that transforms sentences and paragraphs into representations that encapsulate not just the words but the meaning. These ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù representations are stored and used to calculate the closest neighbors in a multidimensional ‚Äúmeaning space.‚Äù This space is high-dimensional, enabling it to capture the many nuances of meaning embedded in language. It‚Äôs truly fascinating technology, offering immense potential to enhance both our minds and knowledge vaults!

## Privacy and Security

One of Obsidian's greatest strengths is its commitment to data ownership and privacy. This plugin upholds that philosophy by making privacy its highest priority. All processing and note relations happen entirely on your device, ensuring your notes stay yours‚Äîalways. 

**Related Notes Finder** is built with privacy at its core:  
- **Local Processing**: Every analysis and operation occurs directly on your device. Your notes never leave your vault.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or new features, please open an issue or submit a pull request to start a discussion.  

This plugin relies on [relate-text](https://github.com/JoramMillenaar/relate-text) for much of its core logic. Contributions to this library are equally encouraged and will directly enhance the functionality of the plugin.

### TODO  
Here are the current development goals for the plugin:  
- Pass the note's title to the embedder as well (maybe even make it weighty)
- Kill the local API when Obsidian is quit (I've tried multiple ways, seems to be a challenge)
- Ensure the `onload` method is non-blocking by deferring data fetching to the `onLayoutReady` callback.  
- Add option to show notes to a similarity threshold, rather than a set amount of notes.
- Investigate using `this.app.metadataCache.getFileCache(file)` for file parsing instead of regex on raw content.  
- Find a more suitable template for extending the custom view.  
- Consider renaming the plugin to something like **Deeplink**, **Meaning Map**, **SmartLink**, or **Relate Notes**.  
- Look into and fix odd resuls in similarity after updating note embeddings
- Test windows compatibility
